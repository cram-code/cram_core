      <h1>Grid Structured Data (GSD)</h1>
      <p>
	Grid Structured Data (GSD) is a collection of Common Lisp
	systems designed to provide common definitions for the
	construction, composition, and extraction of arrays and other
	data that is organized in a grid structure, and to provide
	standard interfaces to common representations for such
	objects.
      </p>
      <p>The following functions are provided:
	<ul>
	<li><code>make-grid</code>,
	<li><code>map-grid</code>,
	<li><code>map-n-grids</code>,
	<li><code>drop</code>,
	<li><code>subgrid</code>,
	<li><code>row</code>,
	<li><code>column</code>,
	<li><code>transpose</code>,
	<li><code>diagonal</code>,
	<li><code>concatenate-grids</code>,
	</ul>
	and more.  For example, 
      </p>
      <p>There are two systems, <code>grid</code> that defines the
	functions and grid classes, and <code>foreign-array</code> that
	defines foreign arrays as grids.  Work is incomplete on these
	systems, but they provide basic functionality requested by
        scientific and engineering computation.
	Incomplete documentation is provided in
	<code>gsd/documentation/grid/index.html</code>.
      </p>
      <p>This work is still very much under development.  It
	has been developed in response to 
      incorporated into <a href="">GSLL</a>. in response to the need
      shown 
      </p>
	
      <p>Based on AFFI.</p>
