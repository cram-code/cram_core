;;; ABOUT FACTS, FACT GROUPS, PREDICATES AND FUNCTORS 
;;;
;;; We try to stick with prolog terminology, but some things are also
;;; different. Interesting to the reader could be the following prolog
;;; dictionary: http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/prologdict.html
;;;
;;; Fact definitions have the following layout:
;;;   (fact-head . list-of-clauses)
;;;
;;; The fact head is sometimes called the pattern and the list-of clauses also
;;; called the body of the fact.
;;;
;;; The fact head must be a list with a symbol (not a variable) in the
;;; car. This is called the functor.
;;;   ((functor . rest-of-pattern) . list-of-clauses)
;;;
;;; As of now we don't distinguish between predicates with the same functor,
;;; but different arity.
;;;
;;; Facts are defined with the (<- head . body) macro. For interactive
;;; development in order to be able to "recompile" an bunch of facts easily,
;;; facts can only be defined in fact-groups. When you reevaluate a fact group
;;; (e.g. C-c C-c in emacs+slime) it removes all previously defined facts for
;;; this fact group before adding the current set of facts.
;;;
;;; The totality of all facts for a functor are a predicate. For each
;;; predicate the facts usually may be defined only in one fact-group, since
;;; defining facts for the same predicate in multiple fact groups is usually a
;;; mistake and can cause subtle bugs.
;;;
;;; In order to allow certain predicates to still be defined accross fact
;;; groups, DEF-FACT-GROUP takes a list of functors that may be defined in
;;; this fact group even if they are already defined in another fact
;;; group. One particular use case for this is the HOLDS predicate, which is
;;; quite general. It would be impractical to define all HOLDS facts in one
;;; fact group only.
;;;
;;; A note on synchronization: At the moment we assume that facts are only
;;; defined at "compile-time" and thus do not synchronize the data structures
;;; used here. Access to fact definition and thus prolog queries are pure
;;; functions and need not be synchronized even if called by multiple threads.
;;;
;;; ON THE DATA STRUCTURES USED
;;;
;;; *FACT-GROUP-FACTS* is a hash table that keeps a list of (functor . facts)
;;; pairs with all prediactes defined in each fact group. This is used to
;;; remove a fact group together which all its fact definition and then build
;;; the complete list of remaining facts for each functor. Removing a fact
;;; group is needed to allow "recompilation" in interactive development.
;;;
;;; *PREDICATE-FACTS* also is a hash table that is indexed by the functors and
;;; keeps a list of all fact defintions as well as information about the fact
;;; groups the facts came from. The entries in this hash table are of the form
;;; (fact-group-names . list-of-facts), where fact-group-names is a list of
;;; fact groups that defined facts for this predicate and list-of-facts is the
;;; list of all facts from all fact groups for this predicate. If a prediacte
;;; is defined by only one fact group (which is the usual case), then
;;; fact-group-names simply is a list with one element.
;;;
;;; This representation means that every fact is present twice, once in
;;; *FACT-GROUP-FACTS* and once in *PREDICATE-FACTS*. This is intentional, as
;;; the representation is optimized for speed of reading access (the list of
;;; all facts for a functor is always the CDR of the the entry in
;;; *PREDICATE-FACTS*). Addition and removal of fact-groups is not time
;;; critical, as it happens at "compile time".
